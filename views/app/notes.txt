- In app.js
    - add with folder name:
    app.use("/tuyyo_dashboard/static", express.static(__dirname + '/views/app/tuyyo_dashboard/static'));
    
- In your index.html, change the script and css source:
    <script type=text/javascript src=/tuyyo_dashboard/static/js/manifest.2ed6244d082924313e3f.js></script>
    
- In static/js/app.b2131b23b1.js
    - Find all the /static references and replace it with what you put for the app.use in app.js
